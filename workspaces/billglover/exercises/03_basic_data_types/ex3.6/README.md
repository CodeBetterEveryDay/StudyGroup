# The Go Programming Language

The following exercise is taken from the book, [The Go Programming Language](https://amzn.to/2ENCgcO) by Alan Donovan and Brian Kernighan. The book does not contain solutions and so all solutions shown here are my own work. They may not be the best solutions out there and feedback is always welcome.

## Exercise 3.6

> "Supersampling is a technique to reduce the effect of pixelation by computing the color value at several points within each pixel and taking the average. The simplest method is to divide each pixel into four 'subpixels'. Implement it."
